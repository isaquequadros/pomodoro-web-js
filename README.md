# pomodoro-web-js



## A website to get focus


### In this project, I took the pomodoro technique off paper and created it into a dynamic web page. I learned a series of features with JavaScript, I made background music play if the user wanted to enable this option, I also learned how to optimize the code, reuse and perform maintenance. I put Crud into practice and integrated it with the form, now the user will be able to add, edit and remove information. I implemented the use of LocalStorage to save and also to persist data in the browser.
